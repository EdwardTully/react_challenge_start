# react_challenge_start
Codecademy React project, featuring useState, props, map(), eventHandlers, callback functions, input patterns, forms, adding objects to state arrays, event target values,
props, Object.values(value).map(valule,i) object mapping method.  The projects allows user to create a contact list, and maintain an appointment list utilizing contact list 
names in a dropdown menu input.  Daunting at first due to scant instructions, but similar to my rolodex project.
